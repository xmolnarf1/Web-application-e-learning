# Web-application-e-learning
Bachelor’s thesis project – Web-based e-learning application built with PHP, Bootstrap 5, and MariaDB, hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5.

This application was created as part of my Bachelor’s Thesis: “Webová aplikácia e-learning”.  
The aim was to design and implement an interactive platform for teaching the basics of cryptocurrencies, supporting multiple user roles, and hosting it on a Raspberry Pi 5 server.  
It provides students, teachers, and administrators with tools for managing courses, lessons, and quizzes in an engaging way.
